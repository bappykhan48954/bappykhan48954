### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ahammad Ullah. I'm currently studying Materials and Metallurgical Engineering (MME) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). I have a great interest in machine learning (ML) and computational material science. To fulfill my interest, I learned Python, Machine learning, and Deep learning at Coursera during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on undergraduate thesis.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Computational Material Science and Quantum mechanics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a research project related to Machine Learning and computational material science.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my learning in computational material science.
